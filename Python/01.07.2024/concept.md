Here's a `README` file that covers the topics you've listed, providing a brief overview and examples for each concept:

# Python Programming Concepts

## 1. Python Class

A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. Classes encapsulate data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.

### Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species

    def make_sound(self):
        print("Some generic sound")
```

## 2. Inheritance in Python

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

### Example:
```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name, species="Dog")
        self.breed = breed

    def make_sound(self):
        print("Bark")
```

## 3. Polymorphism in Python

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.

### Example:
```python
def animal_sound(animal):
    animal.make_sound()

dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Bark
```

## 4. Modules in Python

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules can define functions, classes, and variables that you can reuse in other Python scripts.

### Example:
```python
# file: my_module.py
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Usage in another script
import my_module
my_module.greet("Alice")
```

## 5. Exception Handling (Try Except)

Exception handling is used to handle errors gracefully in a program.

### Example:
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
```

## 6. File Handling - Read and Write

Python provides various methods to read and write files.

### Example:
```python
# Writing to a file
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")

# Reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```
