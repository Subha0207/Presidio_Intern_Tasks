(1)Set Up a Virtual Environment:

It's a good practice to use virtual environments to manage dependencies for different projects.
command:
python -m venv env_name.

(2)Activate the virtual environment:

Windows: env_name\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source env_name/bin/activate

(3)Install Required Packages:

Use pip install package_name to install any necessary libraries or frameworks.
