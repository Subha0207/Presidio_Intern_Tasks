C,C++ are compiled languages

Byte code is converted to machine language by Interpreter(Python Virtual machine)
In compiled languages ,execution takes place as a whole program(Output is not dispalyed even when single error exists in any one of the line)
In interpreted languages,execution goes line by line(Output will be displayed for non error lines)
In python compilation and interpretation is done by Python Virtual Machine and output is shown
Python is an interpreted language
